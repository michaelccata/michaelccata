## Hey there, nice to meet you!

I'm a management consultant who, sometimes, writes code. I love working with large organizations eager to move from endless "strategy and planning" to actually making stuff. Today that often includes technology and, more often, the teams necessary to build great digital products. My research and expertise focus on cross-functionality in organization design and how that affects large, strategic initiatives especially those including new technology.

I do this full time @ [Etsy](https://etsy.com) as a researcher and strategist for our international growth ambitions working across product and marketing to scale how we build a better marketplace for buyers and sellers around the world.

**My career history:**

_Short:_

* Improved how Etsy localizes product discovery across all its recommenders across billions of visits.
* Integrated two marketplace acquisitions under the Etsy corporate umbrella (and helped spin one out.)
* Architected and launched a cloud-based policy forms library for a publicly traded insurance company automating the work of hundreds of underwriters and lawyers.
* Rebuilt the applicant facing system for all federal background investigations following a massive breach. Tens of thousands of people use this every year.
* Advised the United States Navy on a platform that helps sailors manage their career.
* Worked with leadership [here](https://www.argolimited.com/pages/argo-group-home) to create three digital teams across the country that are building great product [here](eager.to).
*  Rebuilt compliance architecture, operations, and tools at a global bank.
*  Developed a common mission for marketing with the biggest snacks and beverage maker in the world.
*  Tested and released a global payroll automation for the largest investment bank.

_Long_
I am a turnaround specialist with expertise in reorganizations, technology modernization, and data analysis. As the International Strategy and Analytics, M&A Corporate Integration Senior Manager at Etsy, I've implemented multi-million dollar efficiency improvements by localizing product listing feeds across numerous countries. I've also optimized subsidiary cost structures through a global approach to corporate operations, eliminating redundant expenses while enhancing compliance and service quality.

Before joining Etsy, I founded McCallum & Partners, a management consultancy specializing in strategy and code integration. My standout achievement was rebuilding a publicly-traded insurance company's policy forms database in just six months, transforming an on-premises application into a modern cloud-native solution. This new system serves over 10,000 policy documents via multiple APIs, significantly improving efficiency for underwriters who previously struggled with decentralized forms libraries.

At the General Services Administration [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), I spent nearly five years as a Senior Product Manager and Strategy Consultant, managing approximately $10 million in consulting projects across federal government agencies. We were civil servants serving other civil cervants. We improved the workings of bureaucracy through prototypes, transformation initiatives, user-centered research, assisted acquisitions, and even full-blown product builds. I'm most proud to have led a 12-person software development team with a $3 million budget to modernize the government's background investigation system, which processes over one million checks annually. The [application](https://github.com/18F/culper/wiki) is now live in a DOD production environment where I imagine it will serve the public for a very long time.

My earlier roles included strategic work at Undercurrent, where I led an 18-month engagement with an insurance company to develop their digital strategy and build cross-functional teams that eventually grew to over 75 employees and generated $20+ million in premiums. I began my career at IBM implementing enterprise solutions for global payroll automation. A graduate of Ohio State University with a Bachelor's in Economics and Political Science, I possess technical proficiency in R, SQL, Python, and various data analysis platforms.

**Personal notes:**
In my spare time you can find me hiking a National Park, jamming out to some classic rock, reading economic history, drinking fancy coffee, or pouring over management documents from the 19th Century at the Library of Congress.


**Coffee!**
Speaking of coffee, let's grab some if you're in the Queen City, [first cup's on me.](/coffee)
