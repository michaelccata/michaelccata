## Hey there, I'm Michael, nice to meet you!

I'm a management consultant who, sometimes, writes code. I love helping organizations (big and small) move from endless planning to actually building great products. My expertise lies in cross-functional organization design and its impact on strategic initiatives, particularly those involving new technology. Currently, I work at [Etsy](https://etsy.com) as a researcher and strategist for our international growth team, collaborating across product and marketing teams to create a better marketplace for buyers and sellers worldwide.


**My career history:**

_Long_

I am a turnaround specialist focused on reorganizations, technology modernization, and data analysis. At Etsy, as the International Strategy and Analytics, M&A Corporate Integration Senior Manager, I've implemented multi-million dollar efficiencies by localizing product listing feeds across numerous countries and optimized subsidiary operations through a global approach.

Before joining Etsy, I founded McCallum & Partners, specializing in strategy and code integration. My standout achievement was rebuilding a publicly-traded insurance company's policy forms database in just six months, transforming an on-premises application into a modern cloud-native solution serving over 10,000 policy documents.

At the General Services Administration 18F, I spent nearly five years managing approximately $10 million in consulting projects across federal agencies. I led a 12-person software team with a $3 million budget to modernize the government's background investigation system, which handles over one million checks annually.

My earlier roles included strategic work at Undercurrent, where I led an 18-month engagement developing digital strategy and building cross-functional teams that eventually generated $20+ million in premiums. I began my career at IBM implementing enterprise solutions for global payroll automation, after graduating from Ohio State University with a Bachelor's in Economics and Political Science.


**Personal notes:**
In my spare time you can find me hiking a National Park, jamming out to some classic rock, reading economic history, finding coffee shops, or pouring over management documents from the 19th Century at the Library of Congress.


**Coffee!**
Speaking of coffee, let's grab some if you're in the Queen City, [first cup's on me.](/coffee)
